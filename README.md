# Monotaur

Exploration project to check Three.js features and capabilities.

Goals:

- [x] Extrude 3D surfaces from SVG shapes.

    Example: Extrude I-beam surface from `I` shape.

  - [x] Tricky part: cut-out shapes with subtracted geometry.

    Example: Extrude ring surface from `O` shape.

- [ ] Boolean Intersect two perpendicular surfaces extracted that way.
